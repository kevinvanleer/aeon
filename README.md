Arrive uses device location and search queries to provide travel times.  Search queries entered by the user and device location are sent anonymously to third-party services to provide meaningful search results.  Search history and itineraries built by the user are private and stored only on the device.  Location history is not stored by the application or shared with third parties.  The only time user location is shared is for the purposes of refining search queries.
